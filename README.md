# Windows and Linux: A match made in Heaven!

In this tutorial series we will show you how to create a desktop environment for
Ubuntu in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
In fact, this guide has been written in it!
The tutorial will cover the installation of following programs.
1. I3 Window Manager 
2. Ranger as the file explorer
3. Neovim as text editor 

Begin by checking the version of your current Windows Subsystem for Linux, or by
installing it if it has not yet been installed. 
Open a command prompt and type the command
```shell
wsl -l -v
```

The output should be something along the lines of
```
  NAME            STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-18.04    Running         2
```

This guide does not work for version 1, if yours is not version 2, some great 
tutorials exist to upgrade to version 2.
